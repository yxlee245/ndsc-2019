# National Data Science Challenge 2019
This repo contains the codes that I used for doing stuff related to Computer Vision, for NDSC 2019 by Shopee.

The notebooks and python scripts in the `src` folder are broadly classified in 4 groups:
1. Data exploration and preparation
2. Baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models
3. Simple bounding box model
4. Object detection model

__Note__:
1. The simple bounding box model doesn't work well. Use at your own risk.
2. The object detection model was adopted from this [well-explained repo by Github user sgrvinod](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection).
3. The CNN and object detection models were built using PyTorch. For TensorFlow/Keras users, please adjust accordingly.
